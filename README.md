### Hello there
[![Yeah yeah here's the GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=Jubilee101&count_private=true&theme=graywhite)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

**Yeah, flashing stats is cheesy but here we are Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯**

**I like systems and open source.**

**I love feedbacks and suggestions! Tell me what you think [here](https://forms.gle/egNuZ2oQaJbcjjnm6), it's anonymous!**

**Fun fact: I got my GitHub ID from Paul McCartney's *Junk*, before I knew it was quite hard to change after a while...**
